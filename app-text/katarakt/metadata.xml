It's a PDF viewer. It views PDFs.

There are currently two layouts. The presentation layout is very
simple and only supports scrolling on a per page basis. As the name
suggests the current page is displayed in the center and zoomed to fit
the window. It is active by default.

The grid layout is much more advanced and offers continuous (smooth,
per pixel) scrolling, zooming and adjusting the column count. Pages
keep their correct relative size and are shown in a grid.
